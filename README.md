# 🎮 Silo City Games 🎮

Welcome to the digital playground where pixels meet passion! Silo City Games is the official hub for all the awesome gaming projects and tools we're cooking up. This isn't just a website; it's a launchpad for fun!

## 🚀 A Legendary Collaboration! 🚀

This project is the epic result of a tag-team effort between two creative powerhouses: [**SiloCityLabs**](https://silocitylabs.com) and [**OneBuffaloLabs**](https://onebuffalo.com). We're a dynamic duo where code, creativity, and chaos collide to forge awesome digital realities. Blending our skills in development and design, we're on a united mission to build cool stuff for the gaming community.

## 🛠️ Get Ready to Build & Run!

Want to get your hands dirty and run the site on your own machine? Awesome! Just follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (which includes npm) installed on your system.

### Installation

First, clone the repository and install all the necessary dependencies. Open your terminal and run:

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone [https://github.com/SiloCityLabs/silocitygames.com.git](https://github.com/SiloCityLabs/silocitygames.com.git)

# Navigate into the project directory
cd silocitygames.com

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

### Running the Development Server

To start the local development server and see the magic happen in your browser, run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will fire up the site, usually at `http://localhost:5173`. The server will automatically reload as you make changes to the code. How cool is that?

### Building for Production

When you're ready to build the optimized, production-ready version of the site, run this command:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create a `dist` folder with all the static assets you need to deploy your site to the world!
